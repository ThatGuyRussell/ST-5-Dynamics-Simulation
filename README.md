ST-5-Dynamics-Simulation
========================

Space Technology (ST-5) consisted of 3 spinning spacecraft in the same eccentric  orbit around the Earth but spaced apart. The goal was to measure variations of the  Earthâ€™s magnetic field. For each location above the Earth, magnetic field was  measured 3 times. The goal of this project is to model one of the ST-5 spacecraft and  compare that model to how the spacecraft actually performed.
